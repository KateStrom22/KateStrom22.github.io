        <h1>Color Scheme</h1>

        <p>Site colors and what will be those colors, also why?: 
            <br>Just like with the typography I am not sure quite what is required (Yes, I did try to look and figure it out). I decided to go off of my best guess and modify things as I go. 
            <br><br>I chose a goldenrod type color (#FED01A), a lighter version of that color, so a light gold or yellow (#FFFEC5), a mid tone blue (#6EC0F0), a lighter blue (#9BD5EF) and finally a darker blue (#2D456C).

            <br><br>I plan to use the yellows in the header and footer, the blues for the nav, and the extra dark blue for accents on the page. I thought the yellows were a good bright happy color that reflected the psychology of good weather and good times. Blue is proven to be a color that gives viewers the feeling of trust and safety, so using that in the nav not only gives viewers the feeling of calm, safe, and to be trusted, but it is also like a blue sky on a clear day. For now I plan to leave the background white, or maybe have block sections that are a very pale blue or yellow.
